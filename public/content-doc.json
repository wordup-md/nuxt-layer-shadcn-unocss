Like spans, emojis, icons, etc. Inline components can be defined by a single `:` followed by the component name.\n\n```md\nA simple :inline-component\n```\n\nYou may want to pass some text into an inline component; you can do it using the `[TEXT]` syntax.\n\n```md\nA simple :inline-component[John Doe]\n```\n\nIf you want to use an inline component followed by specific characters like `-`, `_`, or `:`, you can use a dummy props specifier after it.\n\n```md\nHow to say :hello{}-world in Markdown\n```\n\nIn this example, `:hello{}` will search for the `<Hello />` component, and `-world` will be plain text.\n\n::alert\nNote: If you put an inline component alone in a single line, it will be transformed into a block component. This is sugar syntax for block components.\n\n```md\nParagraph a\n\n:block-component\n\nParagraph b\n```\n::\n\n## `::` Block Components\n\nBlock components are components that accept Markdown content or another component as a slot.\n\nBlock components are defined by the `::` identifier.\n\n```md\n::card\nThe content of the card\n::\n```\n\nBlock components can be used without any content.\n\n```md\n::card\n::\n```\n\nOr with sugar syntax. Note that in sugar syntax, it is important to put the component alone on a separate line.\n\n```md\nA paragraph\n\n:card\n```\n\n## `#` Slots\n\nBlock components can accept slots (like Vue slots) with different names. The content of these slots can be anything from a normal markdown paragraph to a nested block component.\n\n- The `default` slot renders the top-level content inside the block component.\n- Named slots use the `#` identifier to render the corresponding content.\n\n```md\n::hero\nDefault slot text\n\n#description\nThis will be rendered inside the `description` slot.\n::\n```\n\n## `:::` Nesting\n\nMDC supports nested components inside slots by indenting them. To make nested components visually distinguishable, you can indent nested components and add more `:` when you define them.\n\n```md\n::hero\n  :::card\n    A nested card\n\n    ::::card\n      A super nested card\n    ::::\n  :::\n::\n```\n\n## `[]` Span\n\nTo create inline spans in your text, you can use the `[]` identifier.\n\n```md\nHello [World]\n```\n\nThis syntax is useful in combination with inline props to make text visually different from the rest of the paragraph. Check out the inline props section to read more about props.\n\n```md\nHello [World]{.bg-blue-500}!\n```\n\n## `{}` Inline Props\n\nUsing the inline props syntax, you can pass props and attributes to your components. MDC goes a step further and allows you to pass attributes to markdown native elements like images, links, bold texts, and more.\n\nTo define properties for a component or a markdown element, you need to create a props scope `{}` exactly after the component/element definition. Then you can define the properties inline within this scope using a `key=value` syntax.\n\n```md\nInline :component{key=\"value\" key2=value2}\n\n::block-component{no-border title=\"My Component\"}\n::\n\n[Link](https://nuxt.com){class=\"nuxt\"}\n\n![Nuxt Logo](https://nuxt.com/assets/design-kit/logo/icon-green.svg){class=\".nuxt-logo\"}\n\n`code`{style=\"color: red\"}\n\n_italic_{style=\"color: blue\"}\n\n**bold**{style=\"color: blue\"}\n```\n\nThere are also a couple of sugar syntaxes for common use-cases:\n\n- `id` attribute: `_italic_{#the_italic_text}`\n- `class` attribute: `**bold**{.bold .text.with_attribute}`\n- No value (boolean props): `:component{no-border}`\n- Single string without any space: `**bold**{class=red}`\n\nIf you want to pass arrays or objects as props to components, you can pass them as a JSON string and prefix the prop key with a colon to automatically decode the JSON string. Note that in this case, you should use single quotes for the value string so you can use double quotes to pass a valid JSON string:\n\n```md\n::dropdown{:items='[\"Nuxt\", \"Vue\", \"React\"]'}\nString Array\n::\n\n::dropdown{:items='[1,2,3.5]'}\nNumber Array\n::\n\n::chart{:options='{\"responsive\": true, \"scales\": {\"y\": {\"beginAtZero\": true}}}'}\nObject\n::\n```\n\n## `---` Yaml Props\n\nThe YAML method uses the `---` identifier to declare one prop per line, which can be useful for readability.\n\n```md\n::icon-card\n---\nicon: IconNuxt\ndescription: Harness the full power of Nuxt and the Nuxt ecosystem.\ntitle: Nuxt Architecture.\n---\n::\n```\n\n## `{{}}` Binding Variables\n\nThe `{{ $doc.variable || 'defaultValue' }}` syntax allows you to bind variables in your Markdown content. This is especially useful when you want to dynamically insert values into your document.\n\nTo use this syntax, simply enclose the variable name within double curly braces, like so:\n\n```md\n---\ncolor: blue\n---\n\n# The color is {{ $doc.color || 'red' }}.\n```\n",
